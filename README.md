## Introduction
![mindskip.svg](mindskip.svg)

Traditional transformer models allocate a fixed amount of computational resources to every input token, leading to inefficient and unnecessary computation. To address this inefficiency, [Mixture of Depths (MoD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02258) was introduced, dynamically adjusting computational depth by skipping less important layers. While promising, current MoD approaches face two significant challenges:

1. **High Training Costs**: Existing methods require training the entire model alongside routers, which determine which layers to skip, resulting in substantial computational overhead.
2. **Risk of Performance Degradation**: Bypassing important layers can lead to a drop in model performance.

To overcome these challenges, we introduce [**Router-Tuning**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13184), a method that fine-tunes only the router on a small dataset, drastically reducing the training costs. Additionally, we propose **Mindskip** (Attention with Dynamic Depths), which preserves model performance while significantly enhancing computational and memory efficiency. 

Our approach delivers competitive results, achieving up to **21% speedup** with only a **0.2% performance drop**, demonstrating its effectiveness in balancing efficiency and performance.

- **Oct 2024**: Published preprint on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13184) along with the related codebase.

## Quick Start

#### Installation

```bash
conda create -n router-tuning python=3.10
conda activate router-tuning

git clone https://github.com/CASE-Lab-UMD/Router-Tuning

cd ./Router-Tuning
pip install -e .
```


## Train

```bash
sh /scripts/finetune_mndskip.sh
```

## Evaluation 

The evaluation code is based on [EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness). To fully reproduce our results, please use [this version](https://github.com/s1ghhh/lm-evaluation-harness). It samples few-shot based on the index of the samples, avoiding the issue of result variation with the number of processes during data parallel inference.
